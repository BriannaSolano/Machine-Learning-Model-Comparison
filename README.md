# Machine-Learning-Model-Comparison

Tackled two machine learning tasks (Regression and Classification) and compared two different models per task. 

Task 1: Regression
----------------------------
- These models were trained on a housing dataset that contained different features such as GarageArea, Neighborhood, and ex...
- Developed 2 models K - nearest neighbors and linear regression that would predict the cost of the house and compared their acurreacy, errror rate, and speed

Task 2: Classficiation
-------------------------------------
- These models were trained on MNIST dataset that is composed of handwritten images of integers from 0 to 9.
- Developed 2 models K - nearest neighbors and logistic regression that would predict the label of each image and compared their acurracy, error rate, speed, and confusion matrix.
